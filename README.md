# Sign Language Detection using Action Recognition

## Description
This project implements a sign language detection system using action recognition techniques. It leverages computer vision and deep learning to identify and classify sign language gestures from video input, enabling real-time translation of sign language into text.

## Features
- Real-time sign language gesture detection
- Action recognition using deep learning models
- User-friendly interface for video input
- Support for multiple sign language gestures
- Easy-to-extend for additional gestures

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (specify which one you use)
- NumPy
- Streamlit (if you have a web interface)
- Other relevant libraries

## How to Use?
1. Clone the repository:
3. Install the required dependencies:
   
    ````
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ````


5. Run the application:
   ````
   python main.py
   ````

7. Follow the on-screen instructions to start detecting sign language gestures from your webcam
